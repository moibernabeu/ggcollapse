# ggcollapse: an R package to collapse nodes using ggtree
This package contains a set of functions that expand the `ggtree` package. The main function of this set, `ggcollapse` allows the user to collapse nodes with the same height for the collapsing triangles. The package also contains some functions that help in the task of finding monophyletic groups of a certain taxonomic rank and the full set of sister clades to a given node.
